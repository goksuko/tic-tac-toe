# Tic-Tac-Toe

This is the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented using the minimax algorithm.

You can choose to play as either the X or O player. 
If you select O, the computer will calculate the optimal move and start first (it will take a while). 
If you select X, you will make the first move.

The algorithm assumes that the player will make no mistakes and calculates moves based on that assumption.
