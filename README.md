# Tic-Tac-Toe

This is the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented using the minimax algorithm.

You can choose to play as either the X or O player. If you select O, the computer will calculate the optimal move and start first. If you select X, you will make the first move.

The algorithm assumes that the player will make no mistakes and calculates moves based on that assumption. :)

## Usage
In the cloned directory, the  ```make``` command compiles the program. It will verify if the necessary libraries are installed and download them if required. All libraries used are official Python libraries.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/goksuko/tic-tac-toe
cd push_swap
make
```
